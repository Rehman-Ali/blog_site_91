        "title": "Winter Olympics: Kamila Valieva treatment by entourage 'chilling' - IOC",
        "desc": `Valieva, weighed down by a doping scandal and questions over the wisdom of allowing her to compete, made many mistakes in her free skate performance. There was no hug and no comfort for the 15-year-old from coach Eteri Tutberidze when she came off the ice, instead she was asked why did you stop fighting?.Bach said the incident raised concerns for the future, adding: "When I afterwards saw how she was received by her closest entourage with what appeared to be a tremendous coldness, it was chilling to see this, rather than giving her comfort, rather than to try to help her.Tutberidze, whose training methods were already under the spotlight, did put her arm around the young Russian while she waited for her score. But moments before that had demanded to know: why did you let it go? Explain it to me, why?
    
    Bach said he was "very, very disturbed" by what he had seen when watching the competition on television.
    
    "All of this does not give me much confidence in this closest entourage of Kamila, neither with regard to what happened in the past, nor as far as it concerns the future," he added.
    
    "How to deal, how to address, how to treat a minor athlete at the age of 15 under such an obvious mental stress."
    
    The event was won by Anna Shcherbakova, while fellow Russian Alexandra Trusova took silver. Both are 17 years old and also coached by Tutberidze.
    
    Valieva's participation in the event had been controversial and had meant she had been under the media spotlight for 10 days in Beijing.
    
    She was allowed to compete in the women's event after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) ruled against re-imposing a provisional suspension on her.
    
    She discovered on 8 February - the day after helping the Russian Olympic Committee win the team event - that she had tested positive for angina drug trimetazidine but then successfully appealed against a Russian Anti-Doping Agency decision to impose a provisional suspension.
    
    That decision was upheld by Cas after appeals by the IOC and others, with the court's ruling pointing to "exceptional circumstances" regarding her age and the timing of the test result, which came during the Games and nearly six weeks after the sample was taken.
    
    The Cas ruling said it would do "irreparable harm" to not allow her to compete, but many were left questioning on Thursday whether it had in fact been worse to let her compete.
    
    "I can only wish for her that she has the support of her family, the support of her friends and the support of people who help her over this extremely difficult situation," Bach added.
    
    "And we can then only hope for her to see that this is addressed in the right way and there is not a dramatic experience for such a young woman."
    
    The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) has said it will be investigating Valieva's entourage, including coaches, doctors and other adults surrounding her.`,

        "title": "Sydney shark attack: Beaches reopen after British swimmer's death",
        "desc": `Simon Nellist, 35, was mauled by a shark in the waters off east Sydney on Wednesday.

    Though beaches a now open, a popular charity swim scheduled for Sunday has been cancelled.
    
    State authorities have launched a hunt for the shark - believed to be a 3m-long (10ft) great white.
    
    On Thursday, surf lifesavers on jet skis patrolled a 25km (15.5 mile) stretch of water from Bondi in the city's east to Cronulla in the south to find the shark.
    
    Drum lines, which are used to bait sharks, had also been set up near the area in Little Bay where it struck, and helicopters and drones have been deployed to try and trace its movements.
    
    Swimmers had been banned from entering the water after the attack.
    
    The incident has shaken Sydney, as shark attacks are relatively uncommon. The city has long had nets and other deterrents in its waters to prevent them from happening.
    
    How do you stop sharks attacking?
    Did Australia see more shark attacks in 2020?
    Mr Nellist - who was a diving instructor - was training for the Murray Rose Malabar Magic Ocean Swim when the attack occurred. The swim is an annual event held to raise money to provide swimming lessons for children with disabilities.
    
    Organisers of the swim said the event would be cancelled.
    
    "Out of respect for Simon and his family... we believe that cancelling the 2022 swim is appropriate," event director Robert Lloyd said in a statement.
    
    A UK foreign office spokesperson said consular staff were in touch with New South Wales Police. "We are supporting the family of a British man and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time," the spokesperson said.`,

        "title": "All That Breathes: The Indian brothers who heal birds dropping from the sky",
        "desc": `Mohammad Saud and Nadeem Shehzad rescue birds of prey - mostly injured by paper kite strings coated with crushed glass - and carry them in cardboard boxes to a claustrophobic basement garage at home. Here, they begin nursing them to health: cleaning and bandaging wounds, fixing slashed wings and broken bones.

    "You don't care for things because they share the same country, religion or politics," intone the brothers in All That Breathes, an award-winning documentary film on their work.
    
    "Life itself is kinship. That's why we can't abandon the birds."
    
    All That Breathes - the recent winner of the World Cinema Documentary Competition at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival - is not a film that is eager to startle or preach.
    
    Shaunak Sen's 91-minute documentary is, at once, a meditative tribute to the brothers, a rumination on climate change, and an unsparing look at life in Delhi's dystopian underbelly. The Hollywood Reporter calls it a "tiny marvel of a documentary, it's a little and a lot all at once".
    
    The dank and derelict basement, where much of the film is shot, has a quiet and purposeful air. The brothers treat the maimed birds on a table. Crammed cheek-by-jowl are men at metal-cutting machines making liquid-soap dispensers, a small family business. A hatchback is parked in a corner.
    Small miracles happen in the basement. Here lives are saved, a living is made and there's some levity too. A young assistant to the brothers wonders what will happen to the birds in the event of a nuclear war between India and Pakistan. "Where did you hear that?" asks one of the brothers. "I read it on social media," the assistant says.

Upstairs the family is huddled around the TV that is reporting news of riots breaking out in the city between Hindus and Muslims over a controversial citizenship law. (This was in early 2020.) Outside, kites hover in the smoky air, looking for food on the ground. Not far away, coated in a foamy froth of Delhi's sewage and effluents, the Yamuna river struggles to flow.

On the roof, where the brothers take the birds to recuperate in cages, a kite swoops down from the skies and snatches the assistant's glasses. "Why did the bird steal my glasses?" he wonders pensively.

Why flying kites in India can be deadly
India's bird population 'going down sharply'
The brothers talk about how a neighbourhood bird hospital refused to treat the first kite they rescued because it was a "non-vegetarian bird". At that time, they were teenage bodybuilders and that's how they "came to know about flesh, muscles and tendon". They figured out ways to bandage the kites, and learnt on the job. They became obsessed with birds.

"We'd lie on the ground, watching the elegant curves in the sky," they say. "The head would spin. Have you ever felt vertigo looking into the sky?"

Sen, who has lived all his life in Delhi, told me the idea of the film began with a "visual texture" in his mind: "The hazy sky where the sun is a diffused blot, the all-encompassing greyness, the constant breathing of noxious air." The brothers, he found, had a "deep and profound relationship with the skies and the birds". He spent three years making the film.
Using languid pan shots, Sen's unerring eye for detail helps paint an apocalyptic picture of life in Delhi - an "open wound", as the brothers describe it. Kites looking to scavenge rubbish from a 20-storey-tall rubbish mountain choke the skies. A chimney endlessly belches black smoke.

The cratered street outside the brothers' home becomes a fetid pool of sewage water which leaks into the basement during monsoon rains. Feral pigs wallow in a muddy drain. Air quality reaches dangerous peaks. "My throat feels like charcoal," Mr Shehzad says.

Yet there's life - and hope - in this grotty urban jungle. Monkeys clamber playfully over a thicket of electric wires that hang precariously over narrow streets. An airplane in the sky is reflected in a pool of stagnant water where a centipede slithers. The brothers play cricket in the basement, and eat ice creams in the pouring rain to celebrate government approval for foreign funding for their non-profit.

When the weather clears, the roofs of the matchbox-sized brick homes are crowded with people, and skies are aflutter with their warring paper kites. And then the birds begin dropping, and the brothers are back at their job.

At one point, there are more than 100 wounded birds in the basement. Sometimes they fall after colliding against buildings in the smog or getting entangled in overhead wires. The brothers swim across the river to rescue a bird with a broken wing.

A neighbour appears at the door, looking for tips to protect himself from kites swooping down on his rooftop. They head up there and spot a nestling in a neighbouring building. Carry a stick, wear a helmet and look directly at the bird, which is possibly a hungry mum circling above, they advise him.`,

        "title": "Beijing Olympics: What’s wrong with natural snow?",
        "desc": `Why is Beijing using artificial snow?
    The organisers have insisted on using it to "ensure the quality" at the Games remains high.
    
    Artificial snow was first used in winter sports in the 1980s. Vancouver 2010, Sochi 2014 and Pyeongchang 2018 all relied to some extent on artificial snow.
    
    Beijing has very limited winter snowfall, and the volume of artificial snow used at these Games has reached an unprecedented high of more than 90%. The Yanqing National Alpine Ski Centre has relied almost entirely on the artificial variety.
    
    It is estimated that 49m gallons (222.8m litres) of water have been used to produce millions of cubic metres of snow.
    Which is better for winter sports?
With less air, and more ice, artificial snow is harder and wetter - and also icier, which makes it more suitable for some sports.

It's also easier to maintain a consistent quality throughout competitions, providing as similar conditions as possible for all participants.

Some new snow machines have an on-board computer system that can calculate the most suitable mix of water to produce snow with the same condition down a long ski slope.

"Artificial snow offers consistent and predictable slope conditions," according to the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

"The controllable and adaptable nature of man-made snow makes it a better fit than the natural version for developing ski courses for elite racing."
What do athletes think?
Not all competitors prefer the hard stuff.

Some skiers favour the dry, soft natural snow, as it provides a surface that skis can glide over easily.

Fresh snow also provides skiers and snowboarders with an almost weightless feeling and is often favoured by athletes who are flying off jumps.

The harder, faster artificial snow can also pose risks to athletes.

British freestyle skier Laura Donaldson told BBC Sport man-made snow could be dangerous.

"If freestyle super pipes are formed from snow-making machines in a poor season, the walls of the pipe are solid, vertical ice and the pipe floor is solid ice," she said. "This is dangerous for athletes."`,

        "title": "Kamila Valieva: Anger and sympathy as 15-year-old breaks down at Winter Olympics",
        "desc": `In the end it became one of the most uncomfortable, unpleasant moments of sport in recent memory.

    After a week of outrage following a failed drugs test, 15-year-old Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva left the ice in tears as her controversial Olympics came to a distressing conclusion.
    
    "It should never have happened," said former Olympic champion Robin Cousins, who himself was overcome by with emotion during his commentary.
    
    Elsewhere, there was anger and sympathy as Valieva's Games came to an end...
    
    Who is Valieva?
    Valieva came into the Beijing Games as the biggest star in a highly-rated Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) squad.
    
    The acclaim grew louder when, in the opening days of competition, she became the first woman to land a quadruple jump at an Olympic Games, doing so in the team event.
    
    But soon after that jump helped ROC claim gold, the story began to change.
    
    The medal ceremony was unusually delayed and it was later revealed Valieva had failed a drugs test in December.
    
    She had tested positive for trimetazidine, used in the prevention of angina attacks but on the banned list because it has been proven to improve physical efficiency.
    
    Why was Valieva still competing?
    But Valieva was allowed to compete in the individual event - first in Tuesday's short programme and then the Thursday free skate - because a court ruling lifted her provisional ban following a series of appeals and re-appeals.
    
    The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) pointed to "exceptional circumstances" regarding her age and the timing of the test result, which came during the Games and nearly six weeks after the sample was taken.
    
    It said it would do Valieva "irreparable harm" if she were not allowed to compete.
    
    The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said there would not be a medal ceremony if the Russian finished on the podium. The full doping investigation is yet to follow, meaning Valieva's score could still be removed.
    
    What happened in the final session of the event?
    So to Thursday and the climax of the competition.
    
    As the leader after the short programme, in which she stumbled but comfortably led the standings, Valieva was the last to skate - a score of 255.95 by her team-mate Anna Shcherbakova the one to beat.
    
    But Valieva faltered early on in her routine and, with the eyes of the world on her, tumbled to the ice after one of a number of errors, the crowd gasping in disbelief.
    
    "This is difficult to watch," said BBC commentator Katherine Downes.
    
    "After her second error it was like she was going around as quick as she could," former Olympic champion Jayne Torvill said afterwards.
    
    "It was like she just wanted to get it over with and get off the ice."
    
    When her routine did end the teenager was soon in tears and she sobbed while waiting for her scores. She finished fourth, outside the medal places.
    'She became the face of a problem bigger than her' - what next?
The next step will be the authorities dealing with the matter of Valieva's failed drugs test in full.

That will determine whether the ROC gold in the team event - and Valieva's fourth-placed finish in the individual event - will stand.

There will also be intense questions posted to the authorities - the IOC, ROC, Cas and the International Skating Union, in particular - about how this situation was allowed to develop to the stage it overshadowed the competition and left a 15-year-old in this position.

The World Anti-doping Agency (Wada) has already said it will be investigating the teenager's entourage, including coaches, doctors and other adults surrounding her.

The eventual gold medal winner, the 17-year-old Shcherbakova is, like Valieva, coached by Russian Eteri Tutberidze.

"We have been marvelling at these youngsters coming up," Cousins said. "We watched them - 12 years old with the quad [quadruple jump].

"How is this happening? We know they teach them really young.

"There is obviously an issue - how and why? It is not a question of talent. It is how is that talent being nurtured or created?"`,

    AFP reported that Spanish police sources named De Minaur as one of the athletes on a list of alleged buyers.

    "I want to make it 100% clear that I received my second shot," he said.
    
    "I have a completely valid, accurate and true vaccination record."
    
    Writing on Twitter, De Minaur added: "I received my first dose of the vaccine in London last summer and the second one at the Hospital La Paz in Madrid.
    
    "News came out today that the hospital is under investigation for providing falsified Covid certificates to some of its patients.

        "title": "Five Afghan women who refuse to be silenced",
        "desc": `It was just a snowman. But as winter descended on a starving Afghan population, the heavy snow brought joy to a small corner of Kabul.

    A group of young women had stopped next to the snowman to take selfies. As they giggled and looked at their phones, they could have been anywhere.
    
    Then three Taliban fighters spotted them. They came closer - the women fled. With a smile, one stepped towards the snowman - which perhaps he thought was un-Islamic. He tore off the stick arms, carefully removed the stone eyes, the nose too. Finally, a swift beheading.
    
    I had just arrived back in Kabul after 10 years away and had already been lectured by a member of the Taliban about my lack of understanding of Afghan culture. He claimed to know what was best for Afghan women. "Blue-eyed devils" (Westerners) had corrupted the country, he appeared to suggest.
    
    Rather than take his word for it, I wanted to hear from women themselves. Many are in hiding, all fear for their future and some for their lives. There are still women on the streets of Kabul, some still in Western clothes and headscarves, but their freedom is under attack - the freedom to work, study, move freely and to lead independent lives.
    
    I met women who had been forced into the shadows of a new Afghanistan, who took great risks to express their views freely. They could only do so anonymously - except for Fatima, who insisted on showing her face.
    The Taliban have stolen Fatima’s future twice. The last time they ruled Afghanistan, she was forced into marriage at the age of 14 and her education came to an abrupt end.

This time around, the 44-year-old midwife may still have a job, but like many women I spoke to, every-day life has diminished.

Fatima’s education and employment were hard won. After getting married, she didn’t resume her studies until she was 32. By then, the Taliban had long gone from power. But it still wasn’t easy - even under the new democratic Afghan republic.

I humbly request the Taliban do not meddle in women’s rights to education and employment. Otherwise, they are amputating one arm from the body of society

She says she did a number of fast-track courses within a short space of time - but there were times when she wasn’t allowed to study. “They would take one look at my ID card and say, ‘You are too old to sit in classes with other students.’”

She finally completed her degree two years ago - but again she faced another hurdle.

“It was hard enough for a girl to get educated in Afghanistan, imagine how difficult it was for an old married wife to get hired.” But Fatima succeeded and has since delivered thousands of babies.

“I wanted to work in an area where I would be able to train women,” she says. “When a woman is educated, she raises healthy and fruitful children. By doing so, she can present a meaningful child to society - one that will bring about change.”

Fatima appears to accept that Taliban control is likely to be permanent, but hopes this time around, they can govern differently.`,

        Beaten and humiliated for being a Muslim in India
        Who can stop India WhatsApp lynchings?
        Lynchings and hate speech targeting Muslims have regularly made headlines since 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept to power.
        
        Critics say the accused are often supporters of the party - and that anti-Muslim rhetoric by BJP leaders has emboldened them. The BJP denies the accusations, but its leaders rarely condemn such incidents.
        
        Mr Modi himself was fiercely criticised for remaining silent for weeks after a 52-year-old Muslim man was lynched in 2015 in UP for allegedly storing beef in his home. Weeks later, he broke his silence by saying Hindus and Muslims should fight poverty and not each other. He also criticised cow vigilantes in 2017.
        
        The 2015 killing sent shock waves around the world but in the years since there have been several such attacks on Muslims.
        
        Some of the worst incidents have happened in UP, where the BJP's Yogi Adityanath, a saffron-robed Hindu priest who has often made inflammatory speeches, became chief minister in 2017.
        
        It's hard to say how many lynchings or hate crimes happen every year - in 2017, India's crime records bureau collected the data but did not publish it.

      Graham Potter, 64, had been on the run since 2010 after he failed to show up to court to face conspiracy to murder charges in the state of Victoria.
      
      Police arrested him on Monday morning after they were told he was thousands of kilometres away in Queensland.
      
      Footage of the arrest shows him standing in a dilapidated room before being handcuffed and taken away.
      
      A convicted killer, Potter had earlier been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1981 for the decapitation and murder of a teenage girl. He was released after serving 15 years of his sentence.
      
      On Monday, he was arrested at 08:45 local time (23:45 GMT Sunday) at a house in Ravenshoe, in far north Queensland.
      When he went into hiding, Potter was facing federal charges over an ecstasy and cocaine haul worth A$440m (£232m, $317m), in addition to the conspiracy to murder charges.

There had been several unconfirmed sightings of him across the country since, but police had reached a dead end in their search for Potter in 2017, according to Australian outlet The Age.

A reward of A$100,000 had been offered for information leading to his arrest.

Potter had experimented with changing his appearance and demeanour to evade detection, and he was discovered with items that could disguise him, such as hair dye, according to Victoria Police.

"This certainly puts a long and protracted end to a hunt for a very high-end fugitive that is wanted for very serious criminal charges," said Mick Frewen, Acting Assistant Commissioner of Crime Command in Victoria.

Potter will be extradited to Victoria, where he will face court on Tuesday.`,

      "desc":`This announcement from Buckingham Palace that the Queen has tested positive for Covid is a careful balancing act between telling the public about the Queen getting the virus - while at the same time playing down any sense of alarm.

      So the concern about the 95-year-old monarch has been countered by the assurance that the symptoms are mild and she is well enough to carry on working.
      
      Emphasising this business-as-usual approach, the Queen was back at work on Sunday to sign off a message of congratulations to the Winter Olympics curling teams.
      
      Like for the curlers, the royal brushers have smoothed a path for what might otherwise be a worrying message.
      
      In terms of what happens next - the Queen is clearly going to be very carefully monitored by her personal medical team.
      
      Health privacy
      The Queen's physician, Sir Huw Thomas, has previously described his "key priority" as keeping the Royal Household safe through the pandemic.
      But there are likely to be few details of how she might be treated or updates on her Covid case. Buckingham Palace has already said not to expect any "running commentary" in the days ahead.

This reflects a strong convention of privacy surrounding the Queen's health.

When Prince Charles and Camilla recently reported having caught Covid, it wasn't even confirmed whether the Queen had taken a test.

Queen tests positive for Covid
Camilla and Charles have Covid
Who gives the Queen medical advice?
Even though it's believed the Queen has had three Covid vaccinations, only the first has ever been formally acknowledged.

And when the Queen cancelled a series of appearances last autumn because of health problems, details of those medical issues were never made public.

For the Queen's health, the curtain of privacy is kept tightly closed.

So the confirmation that the Queen has Covid has been something of an exception. And having opened that gap in the curtains, there will be great media pressure for more information.

On-screen appearances
This is against a background of a busy year ahead for the monarch during her Platinum Jubilee - and events are likely to reflect the need to be cautious about her health.

Since last autumn, many of the Queen's appearances have been through video screen - and that could be a pattern in the months ahead, with a few personal appearances scattered in between.

A reception she hosted at her estate in Sandringham earlier in February, marking 70 years of her reign, was her first in-person public engagement for several months.

That was followed last week by hosting an audience at Windsor Castle, after other virtual meetings and video messages.`,

      "desc":`Jasmin Moeller has been buying more houseplants over the past two years - like millions of other people around the world.

      With the pandemic meaning that most of us have spent much more time stuck at home, there has been a rush to bring more nature and colour inside, too.
      
      For Ms Moeller, a 38-year-old from Germany, having extra plants in her apartment makes her feel "more comfortable". She adds: "They give me a good feeling. It is like having nature and a calm place at home."
      
      In the UK, online indoor plant retailer Patch says sales soared 500% during the first year of the pandemic. This trend has continued - the latest figures from the Garden Centre Association show that 2021 houseplant sales were 29% higher than in 2020, and 50% up on 2019.
      
      It is a similar picture in other countries, with sales of houseplants in the US rising 18% last year, while those in Germany grew 11% in 2020.
      Yet it is one thing to buy a new houseplant and quite another to successfully look after it, for her part, Ms Moeller freely admits that she is "not very good at taking care of them".

To help her and others who worry about their lack of green fingers, there has been a growth in the sale of hi-tech sensors for indoor plants - devices that you push into the soil next to them.

These sensors are usually solar powered and connect wirelessly by Bluetooth or wi-fi to a user's smartphone and laptop. They show in real time if a plant has enough water or sunlight, and the correct temperature.

Ms Moeller uses a sensor made by German firm Greensens for some of her plants. It has more than 5,000 species on its app database.

"It gives me the opportunity to monitor... and now my plants look healthy," says Ms Moeller, who gets sent regular notifications about how her plants are doing, and whether they need watering in particular.

      "desc":`Jimi Olaghere thought he would have to wait decades to be freed from his sickle cell disease - but now scientists have engineered his blood to overcome the disease which left him in constant pain.

      "It's like being born again," says Jimi, one of the first seven sickle cell patients to have benefited from a revolutionary new gene-editing treatment being trialled in the US. He says it has changed his life.
      
      "When I look back, it's like, 'Wow, I can't believe I lived with that.'"
      
      Jimi, 36, has lived with sickle cell since childhood. "You always have to be in a war mindset, knowing that your days are going to be filled with challenges."
      
      The disease runs in families. It is caused by a genetic mutation that leads to the body making abnormal haemoglobin. This is the protein that is packed into red blood cells and carries oxygen around the body. Red blood cells are normally round and squishy, but mutated haemoglobin can make them rigid and take on their characteristic sickle shape.
      These sickled cells struggle to navigate the body's blood vessels and get stuck, leading to blockages that stop flow of blood. The risk of heart attack, stroke and organ damage are all higher in people with sickle cell disease. Jimi may need a hip replacement because part of his bone tissue has died after being starved of blood - an irreversible condition called avascular necrosis.
      Pain has been a lifelong companion for Jimi. It is like "shards of glass flowing through your veins or someone taking a hammer to your joints", he says. "You wake up in the morning with pain and you go to bed with pain."

But the hallmark of sickle cell disease are the severe pain episodes called crises, which need hospital care and morphine to take the pain away. For years, Jimi was in and out of hospital almost every month. Winters were the worst - as cold weather narrows the blood vessels near the skin and increases the risk of blockages. It is why Jimi moved his family across the US - down from New Jersey to the warmer climes of Atlanta, Georgia.`,

      "desc":`A leading Nigerian artist tells writer Molara Wood why his new installation at London's St Paul's Cathedral is important, as the world-famous building re-evaluates its memorials to historical figures including the admiral who led the campaign that resulted in the looting of the Kingdom of Benin.

      Short presentational grey line
      Spotlights pick out the rhinestones in Victor Ehikhamenor's giant rosary-bead tapestry so that it sparkles, brightening up part of the crypt in the 17th Century cathedral.
      
      This image of the oba, or king, of Benin dominates the space, through which thousands of visitors pass every week, and draws the eye.
      
      Next to it - barely readable and tarnished through time - is a much smaller brass memorial plaque in honour of Admiral Sir Harry Holdsworth Rawson, who led a punitive expedition in 1897 to the West African kingdom of Benin.
      
      He oversaw the British soldiers and sailors who destroyed a centuries-old civilisation, looting and burning down the oba's palace in what is now Benin City in the Nigerian state of Edo.
      
      Their looted treasures - thousands of metal sculptures and ivory carvings made between the 15th and 19th Centuries and collectively known as the Benin Bronzes - are now at the centre of a debate about the return of artefacts taken during the colonial era.
      
      But as his plaque recalls, Rawson was revered at the time for his exploits right across the British Empire.
      Through memorials to hundreds of historical British figures, St Paul's presents a version of the past. But in an ongoing art project the cathedral authorities are attempting to bring new perspectives.

Ehikhamenor's 12ft-tall work (3.7m), Still Standing, was specially commissioned as part of the 50 Monuments in 50 Voices project to tell different stories.

"There is something very powerful about seeing an oba standing there next to the panel memorialising the Benin campaign," the cathedral's chancellor, Dr Paula Gooder, told the BBC.

The work is also a reminder of "the enduring legacies and losses of colonial war", the exhibit's co-curator Prof Dan Hicks said.

St Paul's has decided not to get rid of any of its monuments, recognising that "people had different values" in the past, and instead wants to "engage in a conversation with history," Dr Gooder explained.`,

      "desc":`Singapore is known for being one of the world's most highly urbanised countries, with no lack of gleaming skyscrapers and luxury apartments. But for one man, that couldn't be further from the place he called home - a makeshift shelter in one of the country's forests.

      On meeting Oh Go Seng the first thing that strikes you is the glint in his eye.
      
      He wears his 79 years very lightly, looking in far better shape than many people half his age.
      
      Earlier this month, the story of Mr Oh living in a forest went viral in Singapore - with many across the country reacting with shock.
      
      Some questioned why more help had not been given to him - and even more curiously, how he had managed to live this life unnoticed for 30 years.
      
      Trouble at Christmas
      It all began on Christmas Day when Mr Oh was stopped by officials and found to be trading without a licence.
      
      He was selling leafy vegetables and chillies he had grown - after the pandemic caused him to lose his job selling flowers at markets.
      
      Mr Oh believes he was reported by a disgruntled customer after a disagreement over the SG$1 (£0.55) he was charging for his goods.
      
      At that moment, a charity worker was passing, and noticed he was being spoken to by officials who had confiscated his vegetables.
      
      Vivian Pan said she felt "angry" on his behalf, adding "I didn't want him to go home empty-handed that day".
      
      "But I understand that, in terms of the law, they can't sell on the street," she added.
      
      She filmed the incident and posted it on Facebook, where it quickly went viral - and Mr Oh's plight was eventually brought to the attention of a local member of parliament.
      
      But then the MP, Liang Eng Hwa, soon discovered that there was far more to Mr Oh's story.
      
      He had in fact been living unnoticed in a forest for 30 years.
      
      Living in the forest
      Mr Oh grew up together with his family in Sungei Tengah - a local kampong - or village.
      
      In the 1980s however, these kampongs were knocked down, to make way for new high-rise buildings.
      
      Most kampong residents were offered new homes by the government, but Mr Oh was unable to secure a place of his own.
      
      His brother however, did get a government flat and Mr Oh was invited to live there - but he eventually moved out as he said he did not want to impose on the family.
      
      So, he headed back to a forest close to where his old home once stood and started to spend nights in a makeshift shelter built from pieces of wood, bamboo and tarpaulin.
      
      Upon approaching the shelter, you see ashes in the doorway from the open fire that Mr Oh would cook on. Piles of his belongings sit in the middle of the shelter, with the back of the tent used as his sleeping area.
      
      The garden near his tent is where he would grow his own food. Clothes lines zig-zag between the trees and a fence protects the vegetable plot from intruders.`,

      "desc":`The resignation of Britain's most senior police officer comes after a series of crises has engulfed the Metropolitan Police. Why has it proved so difficult to clean up the toxic culture associated with the force?

      Short presentational grey line
      In full dress uniform, Dame Cressida Dick delivered her resignation speech on the balcony of New Scotland Yard, a slight break in her voice as she described the "honour and privilege" of leading the country's biggest police force.
      
      Her grim-faced aides appeared shocked by the speed of events. Inside the force, she is well-liked. She has defended "my Met", as she has called it, endlessly.
      
      But over her shoulder, on Thursday evening, the lights of London glittered - a city arguably less fond of "its Met", since she took over five years ago. She failed to win the friends outside, that came so easily inside her organisation. Charities representing women, the families of murder victims, and parts of the media turned against her.
      
      There were too many moments when the first woman to run the Metropolitan Police had had to apologise for its behaviour.
      
      Nine hours earlier, the commissioner hadn't been planning to resign. She told a radio phone-in that her staff backed her and even the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, had said he trusted her.
      
      That comment about the mayor seems to have brought him to a tipping point - along with new and horrifying disclosures about Charing Cross police station. His people contacted hers and made things clear. She no longer had his support.

Her five years in charge started with the horrors of the 2017 terrorist attacks and the Grenfell Tower fire, and ends with the pandemic. Crime is up by 4% with 45% fewer cases solved. Knife crime fell as Covid struck, though there has been a recent series of teenage murders and there are concerns violent crime, Dame Cressida's priority, is rising again.
"They get so comfortable in their own company," she says, "that when new people come in, they get indoctrinated to that way of thinking." It is a culture of "corridor comments".

"They disguise it as banter. There's a saying "know your audience". These guys know their audience."

Too often, she says, officers complaining about misconduct, or perceived to be "using the race card" are briefed against, even when they move teams. She should know. It happened to her, again and again. A constant drag on her career ambitions.

The Metropolitan Police has a whistleblowing hotline. A channel for raising complaints about poor attitudes. But Ms Chaudhri said it was used to make false allegations against her, because she had spoken out.

It is possible that a toxic culture at the Met was always there, but we couldn't see it as easily.`,

      "desc":`Fifty years ago the 1972 Five Nations Championship was abandoned, left unfinished for the first and so far only time in its history.

      In the aftermath of Bloody Sunday, the decision by Scotland and Wales not to play in Ireland meant not all the fixtures were fulfilled.
      
      Here, former players and rugby officials recall their thinking at the time, while also looking back on the remarkable events of the following year when, in February 1973, England did travel to Dublin.
      
      Delivered to Lansdowne Road under armed protection, they were welcomed by an emotionally charged crowd of 50,000 in "an act of great friendship".
      
      Short presentational grey line
      This story begins on 30 January 1972, when the British Army's Parachute Regiment shot dead 13 people in Londonderry after opening fire on a civil rights march. The demonstrators had been protesting against a new law giving authorities the power to imprison people without trial in Northern Ireland.
      
      Bloody Sunday will forever be remembered among the most terrible events of the Troubles. In its immediate aftermath, three days later, as some of those killed in Derry were buried, the British embassy in Dublin was set ablaze and destroyed.
      
      The Five Nations of 1972 had opened on 15 January - 15 days before Bloody Sunday. Wales had a strong side, Ireland too. Anticipation among rugby fans was high, but soon the sport was sent into disarray, like so much else.
      
      Ireland began their campaign with victory over France on the outskirts of Paris on 29 January. They would then play England at Twickenham on 12 February.
      
      Willie John McBride, the former Ireland captain, and former British and Irish Lions captain, recalls being accompanied by an armed guard.
      
      He says: "I remember being in London and having protection and asking the guy with me 'How real is this?'
      
      "He said: 'We don't know and we will never know.' So you lived with that hanging over the top of your head all the time.
      
      Bloody Sunday: What happened on Sunday 30 January 1972?
      "I was getting notes and funny things about what I, a northern Protestant, was doing playing for Ireland, but I just carried on."
      
      Ireland won in London, the match ending 16-12. With two victories from two, their final fixtures were at home: against Scotland and Wales.
      
      But following what happened at the British embassy in Dublin on 2 February, a nervousness had crept in among the Scotland and Wales camps. After those teams played each other on 5 February - a 35-12 win for Wales - officials from both unions met to discuss whether they would travel to play Ireland.
      
      Scotland's trip was scheduled first, for 26 February. It was agreed that whatever Scotland decided to do, Wales would follow suit.
      When the Scottish and Irish officials held conversations, they focused on safety guarantees for the Scotland players and the possibility of playing the game elsewhere.

There had been offers to the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) to hold the two games on neutral territory. One came from the Belgian Rugby Football Union of all places, another from the French-Inter Celtic Popular Aid Committee based in Lorient, who said they could arrange for the Wales and Scotland matches to be played in the Breton cities of Rennes and Nantes.

Murrayfield was also put forward as a potential venue but the overwhelming response from the Ulster delegates, who at that time dominated the IRFU, was that it was "Dublin or nowhere".

Another major - but fundamental - issue for the Scots was their struggle to find an insurance company prepared to cover the match in Ireland.

Finally, they decided to pull out - a decision reportedly carried by just one vote. On 17 February it was announced Scotland would not be travelling to Dublin.

Albert Ferrasse, president of the French Rugby Federation, said in reaction: "Rugby has everything to lose and nothing to gain from this."

Irish rugby certainly had plenty to lose.
Ireland had last won the championship 23 years previously in 1949, and in 1972 had a strong side. By mid-February they and the Welsh looked strongest in the hunt for the title.

Whatever the Welsh Rugby Football Union (WRU) had promised their Scottish counterparts, ambitions of national prestige saw them delay making a final decision on whether to play in Dublin.

Having already beaten England 12-3 at Twickenham, and Scotland in Cardiff, Wales had a chance of winning a second consecutive Grand Slam, which up to that point had only been achieved three times in Five Nations history.

Former Wales scrum-half Sir Gareth Edwards says: "Of course we wanted to play from a sporting perspective, but there were serious matters going on. It was very, very difficult for us to think just about playing rugby. A lot of us were just about getting married, lots of people having children.

"We were very friendly with a lot of the Irish players, we tried get some information from them and asked what they thought - we were very concerned.

"I knew quite a lot of the Irish boys and when we went on tours later on and they'd say: 'You should have come.'"

British and Irish Lions back Gerald Davies was one of the first Welsh players to announce he would not play in Ireland. He said it would be unfair to his family. Prop Barry Llewellyn then pulled out too, after receiving a threatening letter claiming to be from the IRA.

Wales were due to play in Dublin on 11 March. On 23 February the WRU held a two-hour special meeting. Secretary Bill Clement confirmed they had resolved to meet the IRFU again.

The Welsh were keen to explore the possibility of a neutral venue. But many IRFU officials believed agreeing to it would be interpreted as accepting that Scotland were right to pull out of playing at Lansdowne Road.

After a meeting between the WRU and the IRFU on 27 February, Wales announced that they would not fulfil the fixture. Hopes of another Welsh Triple Crown or Grand Slam ended. Ireland had similarly missed out on championship glory.

McBride says: "The mood was terrible. I can't remember any game being cancelled because of the Troubles and there had been all sorts of compromises made to keep the game alive. We'd worked so hard to keep rugby union on the ground."

The two cancelled matches had implications for the IRFU's finances - with £60,000 in lost ticket revenue (worth about £840,000 today, according to the Bank of England's inflation calculator).

Irish clubs rallied round to share some of the financial burden by not seeking refunds for tickets bought from the union, and further aid came from France, who played a friendly in Dublin in April, which the Irish won 24-14.

But there was also genuine concern that the Five Nations would be affected for several seasons to come.`,

      "desc":`A boat sent by the government of Mauritius has arrived in the disputed Chagos archipelago in the Indian Ocean, after the country accused the occupying British authorities of "crimes against humanity". The United Nations' highest court has ruled that Britain's occupation of the islands is illegal, but Britain has refused to hand control to Mauritius. Our Africa correspondent Andrew Harding reports from the archipelago.

      On a clear warm afternoon deep in the Indian Ocean, five islanders who were thrown off their remote archipelago by the British half a century ago kissed the sand and cried as they stepped on to the beach of Peros Banhos, one of the larger atolls making up the disputed Chagos Islands.
      
      "This is a great moment," said Olivier Bancoult before lashing out at the British government as "racist" for ignoring Chagossian demands for the right to return to live on the islands.
      
      "This is our birthplace. How can they deny us that right?" he asked.
      
      Almost immediately after stepping ashore, Mauritian government officials began laying a concrete base for a flag post.
      
      "This is not something unusual. It is normal for a nation to raise a flag over its territory," said the Mauritian delegation leader, Ambassador Jagdish Koonjul, pointing to a succession of rulings by the United Nations' top courts recognising Mauritius' sovereignty over the islands, and ordering Britain to end its "illegal occupation" of the archipelago.
      
      A ruined concrete pier, a rusting rail track and rotting buildings overwhelmed by vines and tree roots spoke to the island's isolation and neglect, 50 years after its population of several hundred was ordered to leave within a matter of days. Palm trees crowded in and around the old church, where 68-year-old Liseby Elysee said she had been baptised.
      
      The Chagossians quickly set about clearing coconuts and other debris from the roofless church's floor.
      
      "I am happy to be back. But I am sad that I have to leave again. I want to stay here permanently," said Elysee.
      
      A tearful journey
      Rosamonde Bertin had been watching the horizon for days.
      
      Suddenly, she let out a cry of joy as a large gull-like seabird - known in Bertin's Creole language as a "fou" - swooped over the deck.
      
      "That means we're near land," the 67-year-old said.
      
      A whale emerged briefly from the lead-grey waves on the port side of the boat, followed by a shimmer of silver flying fish.
      
      A few hours later, on Friday afternoon, Bertin burst into applause as it was announced - with a booming blast on the boat's horn - that the vessel she'd been travelling on for four days eastwards had crossed an invisible maritime border deep in the Indian Ocean and entered the disputed territory around the remote Chagos Islands.
      
      "I'm free," she half-screamed, in delight, throwing her arms up in the air.
      
      Free, she explained, because this was the first time since 1972 - when she and her family had been forced off the archipelago by Britain - that she had been able to return "without permission, and without soldiers accompanying me", she said, referring to "heritage visits" previously organised by the UK government.
      
      Beside her, another Chagossian, 57-year-old Suzelle Baptiste, began sobbing quietly as she watched her colleagues dance and celebrate.
      
      "It means so much to me," Ms Baptiste said, through tears.
      
      The two women, and three fellow Chagossians travelling on a boat chartered by the Mauritian government, have made history as the first people to step foot on their isolated archipelago without a British military escort, and without seeking British authorisation.

"I'm so proud. I didn't ask anyone's permission," Bertin declared.

Half a century earlier, Bertin had been 17, newly married and with a six-month-old baby boy, when the supply ship Nodvaer - which brought provisions from Mauritius every few months - had moored off one of the smaller Chagos Islands, Salomon, and announced it had no food on board.

"It was the first sign that they wanted us to leave," recalls Bertin. She nodded vigorously as colleagues described the empty ship as evidence that Britain was busy committing crimes against humanity, by forcibly evicting up to 2,000 people from their homes on the archipelago.`,

      Short presentational grey line
      "People tell me it wasn't my fault. I've been told that thousands of times. I know I was only seven years old, but I shouldn't have left her."
      
      Ricki is walking a personal pilgrimage. His waterproof trousers are splattered with mud and ripped from barbed wire fences. His boots have started to leak and his feet are covered in blisters. But still, he is walking.
      
      He was planning to hang photos of his little sister onto trees as he walked in her memory, but suddenly the idea is too painful. He puts the black and white pictures back inside his rucksack.
      
      "I can't leave her out in the cold. I just can't do it. I can't bear the idea of her smiling face being out here. Not in the wind and rain."
      
      He has brought the ribbon-tied bundles more than 16,000km (10,000 miles) - from his home in Melbourne, Australia - to northern Spain. He is trekking 200km through the chilly Cantabrian Mountains along part of the Camino pilgrim route.
      
      "I'm not a religious person. Not at all. I mean, what kind of religion would allow it to happen? She was only three years old."
      
      Hearing his accent, other walkers ask why he has come to Europe to hike alone in the depths of winter. It must be summer back home. Wouldn't he rather be on the beach? Ricki's smile becomes a wrinkled frown. Now in his late 50s, he tells them he doesn't like the beach.
      
      Cheryl - Ricki's three-year-old sister - vanished in broad daylight from Fairy Meadow beach in New South Wales in early 1970.
      The family had recently arrived in Australia having emigrated from the UK. He was only seven years old at the time, but Ricki has always blamed himself for what happened - because he was looking after Cheryl when she disappeared from the changing rooms at the top of the beach. He turned away for just a few seconds. The police have always been convinced the toddler was abducted, but nobody has ever been convicted.

Ricki stops walking for a moment and looks out across the rugged Spanish landscape. "When I go to my grave, I'll take with me what my eyes have seen and we can share those sights together. I've been talking to her this whole journey - my whole life."

A few yards off the main pathway, we come across an ancient stone chapel. Inside, Ricki places his bundle of pictures on the altar next to some candles. He sits in silence for a few minutes, staring at the images of his smiling little sister.

"She's safe here."

When I walked that section of the Camino with Ricki in 2018, he had never really spoken to a journalist before. He had made the occasional appearance at police press conferences asking for information, but had never opened up about what had happened to Cheryl - and the impact on his life. He wanted to talk to me because, suddenly, this cold case seemed to be moving again.
Police in Australia had recently found a confession in an old box of evidence. It was made by a teenage boy a year after the toddler disappeared. After a new public appeal, detectives tracked down the "boy" - who was now a man in his sixties - and charged him with murder. He pleaded not guilty.

Trekking through Spain was Ricki's way of clearing his head and preparing for the trial. "I need to know. For Cheryl. For all of us. We need answers."

However, when Ricki returned to Australia, a judge ruled the confession could not be used as evidence after all. The prosecution was dropped and the former defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, walked free from court.

"We couldn't believe it. We never knew about the confession," Ricki told me after the case collapsed. "For years, we didn't even know there had been a suspect. Our lives could have been so different. Did we have to go through all this pain and suffering? I don't want any other family to go through what our family has been through. I'm angry. Angry at myself. Angry at the world. Just angry."

The next time I see Ricki in person is in Australia, shortly after the 2019 judgment. He's agreed to work with me on a BBC podcast series about Cheryl's case. We talk about when he first arrived in New South Wales with his family all those years ago.

"We were all so excited," he recalls. "We'd left cold, wet, England to live in the Aussie sunshine. We couldn't believe our luck. It was a fresh start. A new beginning. A new life."`,

      "desc":`The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was a British success story - a home-grown vaccine developed and rolled out in less than 12 months. The ambition was huge: to create a vaccine for the world. But did politics and nationalism get in the way?

      Short presentational grey line
      In the UK, nearly half the adult population has received two doses of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine. It seems highly likely to have saved more lives here to date than the Pfizer and Moderna jabs combined. Yet it is now barely used by the National Health Service. More than 37 million people have received a booster dose in the UK. Just 48,000 of those were AstraZeneca.
      
      The vaccine has also been sidelined in the EU and was never approved in the United States.
      
      So how did we end up here? I've been talking to scientists, politicians and commentators about the fate of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, billed by ministers as "Britain's gift to the world", for a documentary on BBC Two.
      
      I've been asking one central question: did politics and national interests get in the way of ambitions for the vaccine?
      
      Sir John Bell, Regius professor at Oxford University and a man at the heart of the team that got the Oxford vaccine out of the lab and into the arms of millions, is highly critical about decision-makers in the EU
      Let's go back to early 2021. The Alpha variant was driving up Covid hospital admissions and deaths, putting huge pressure on the UK's health service.

Yet it was also a time of hope. The UK had begun to roll out the highly effective Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines - which it had approved here before anywhere else in the world.

The Oxford-AstraZeneca jab was celebrated as a home-grown success story - reflecting the strength of UK biosciences and academia. The government had even looked at the possibility of putting the union flag on the side of the vaccine.

But the scientists at Oxford were uncomfortable with any hint of trumpeting Britishness - by its very nature, a pandemic does not respect borders. The scientists' aim was to tackle the spread of the virus around the world, and prevent new mutations from cropping up in unprotected countries.

"There was too much nationalism," says Prof Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute in Oxford, where the vaccine was developed. "It was encouraging competition between vaccine types, between countries. That's the last thing you want in trying to control the pandemic and provide vaccines for the world."

The vaccine's approval in the UK coincided with Britain's formal separation from the EU.

"I don't think it made relations with Europe any easier that it was promoted as the British vaccine," says Sir John Bell.

In the UK, despite the terrible toll of Covid, there was a buoyant atmosphere in every vaccine centre I attended.

By contrast, the mood on mainland Europe was sombre.

"What we couldn't understand is that while we were deprived of vaccines, we heard that the UK was vaccinating non-stop," says Dr Veronique Trillet-Lenoir, of the European Parliament's Vaccine Contact Group.

By late January, the EU, whose vaccine rollout was lagging behind the UK, finally looked set to approve AstraZeneca.

But before European regulators made their decision, Germany decided it should not be given to those over 65. While in France, President Macron, called the vaccine "quasi-ineffective" in the elderly.

But just hours later, the European Medicines Agency approved the jab for adults of all ages.

Both Germany and France would reverse their decisions, but the reputation of the vaccine had been damaged. Some doctors in France had to throw away doses because nobody was turning up to get the jab.`,

      "desc":`t's early. Fingers of sunlight are only just starting to creep along the streets of Valencia's Old Town, but the stalls inside the city's Mercado Central are doing a brisk trade already. There's a queue at the charcuterie, and the man behind the counter is slicing wafer-thin strips of jamón serrano in double time. He zips from one customer to the next, ducking between stocky legs of ham that hang from the front of his stall like fatty windchimes. In the seafood section, tuna, sea bream, anchovies and huge pink langoustines glisten in the ice. One stall here specialises in snails; another sells only saffron.

      Among them all, taking pride of place at the heart of the Mercado Central, are the fruit and vegetables – plump, richly coloured and all grown in La Huerta (L'Horta in Valencian), a patchwork of neat market gardens that fan out for 28 sq km around the city. Encarna Folgado, owner of Frutas y Verduras Folgado, has been running a stall here for more than 45 years, buying seasonal vegetables direct from the farmers who work in La Huerta's fields. If you need to buy the beans used in a traditional paella Valenciana, you come to Folgado.
      
      "The ferraúra have to have a bright green colour, but not too intense," she tells me, referring to the horseshoe-shaped beans that are almost spilling out of their crate. The rochet, a red and green bean, "has to be a few centimetres wider and thicker, but only a little bit". And as for butterbeans, which I can see bulging through their cases, "the best (ones) to eat are when they begin to turn from yellow to green".
      
      Alongside the beans are spongy heads of broccoli, waxy red peppers, fat garlic bulbs and spring onions the size of truncheons. They're all part of an incredible bounty of produce that is grown in La Huerta each year, despite the fact that its fields enclose Spain's third-largest city. The secret is an ingenious maze of channels, ditches, weirs and floodgates invented by the region's Moorish rulers 1,200 years ago.
      Eight main irrigation channels, or acequías, funnel water from the River Turia, which is then carried – by gravity – along a series of smaller branches, which distribute the water to thousands of tiny plots across the fields. The amount of water each plot receives isn't measured in terms of volume but rather on how well the river is flowing. The unit, known as a fila (from the Arabic word meaning "thread"), represents an individual's right to a proportion of the water over a period of time; the irrigation cycle usually lasts a week, but when the river's level is low, the cycle is extended.

It's an incredibly efficient system. Each plot receives the same access to water for the same amount of time, no matter where they are in the mosaic, and there are no water shortages, even in periods of drought. And the result is an incredibly diverse crop yield. Centuries-old local rice varieties grow in the fields around Lake Albufera, south of the city, while unique species like chufa, or tiger nuts (which are used to make the ice-cold milky Valencian drink of horchata), are sown in the north.

"The system of water management adopted here [means that] aubergines, oranges, artichokes and olive trees can all co-exist together," said Clelia Maria Puzzo of the United Nations' Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO), which added La Huerta to their list of Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) in November 2019. "A variety of crops were imported from Asia and America hundreds of years ago, but they adapted perfectly because of this irrigation system."

The whole process is held together by a unique social organisation that has been governing La Huerta for more than 1,000 years. The Tribunal de las Aguas de la Vega de la València, or Water Court of the Plains of Valencia, was established around 960 CE and as such is officially the world's oldest judicial body. The tribunal is made up of eight farmers, elected representatives of the communities that work off each of the main irrigation channels, who meet to settle disputes outside the doorway of Valencia Cathedral every Thursday at noon.`,

      "desc":`he was a vision in a white dress, as she stood, or half floated, before a white curtain. She was an "apparition", enthused the artist Gustave Courbet. No, there was nothing ghostly or unearthly about her, according to the art critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary, she was "a woman after her wedding night," he said, leaving no doubt what her rosebud lips and dazzled stare evoked in him. She was "charming" felt the poet Charles Baudelaire. While art historian Paul Mantz wondered: "What does she want with her loose hair, her big eyes drowned in ecstasy, her languid attitude?
      From its first showing in a London gallery, under the title Woman in White, trading up on the popularity of Wilkie Collins's 1859 novel of that name, it caused a stir, was derided publicly and critically praised. Like the Mona Lisa centuries before her, Woman in White drew fascinated crowds, speculating about who and what she was.

Much conjecture focussed on the dress. A robe of such dazzling light-suffused whiteness was surely a garment worn by saints and the Virgin Mary, with further allusions to purity and innocence invoked by the white lily in her hand. But what of the flame-red hair, hanging loose, possibly indicative of her morals? And the wolfskin beneath her feet; with its links to wildness, sexuality, and the "beast" waiting to be unleashed inside her – or maybe those who gazed upon her.
Controversy raged around these stereotypes – goddess or "fallen" woman – and what all that whiteness could possibly symbolise: purity, virginity, morality, heaven, goodness, faith, perfection. Whistler was a "ruthlessly ambitious and hard-working artist" who was "determined to make his mark", according to Professor Margaret MacDonald, a co-curator of an exhibition at London's Royal Academy, Whistler's Woman in White, as well as co-author of the accompanying book, who is an expert on Whistler. The book examines the complex, enduring relationship between the artist and Hiffernan, and explores how the sensation around The White Girl, which stood on the threshold of modern art, secured Whistler's place in art history.

While relishing the publicity it attracted, the artist stayed out of the debate on its white-on-white theme, famously retorting that it "simply represents a girl dressed in white standing in front of a white curtain" – in line with the "art for art's sake" credo he subscribed to. Yet despite his apparent insouciance, he painted "Jo" – as he affectionately called her – in white at least five times, three in his symphonies series. MacDonald tells BBC Culture that, in her view,  Whistler's choice of a white dress was partly because it "contrasted splendidly with her hair", and the artist was excited by the technical challenge of painting white on white, a challenge the artist Auguste Renoir spoke later of sharing. 

Whistler and Hiffernan's backgrounds couldn't have been more contrasting. He had a privileged childhood in New England, and grew up surrounded by wealth. Hiffernan came from a poor working-class family from Limerick in Ireland, who arrived penniless in London. She had considerable innate talents; she was (according to Whistler's biographers Elizabeth R Pennell and Joseph Pennell) of "next to no education, but of keen intelligence… [and] great charm of manner". MacDonald says that Jo and her sister Agnes (who were close) were "not quite on the streets… but it was very difficult for somebody with nothing to make a living in London. And they were beautiful, so modelling [for an artist] was certainly one option"."

      -          Paintings of 'rage, rebellion and pain'
      
      The "she" invoking these notable reactions was the subject of The White Girl, a masterpiece created by artist James McNeill Whistler in 1861-2. The model, Joanna Hiffernan, was also a muse, companion and much more to the US-born artist, who was living between London and Paris when the pair met in 1860. At the time of their meeting, Hiffernan, an Irish-born Londoner, was 21. The artist was 26, smitten by her beauty, and her hair, which was "the most beautiful that you have ever seen!" he wrote. "A red not golden but copper – as Venetian as a dream!"`,

      "desc":`Around a year ago, while having my morning shower, I felt a small, round lump under my armpit. It felt hard, like muscle, but shifted position when I pressed down – a bit like cold butter under turkey skin.

      I couldn’t help but google the appearance of lumps – and, thanks to its location, became fixated on the idea that I might have the first stages of leukaemia. It was then that I started having other symptoms: I found that my whole body was aching and tired, and I started to inexplicably lose weight.
      
      My GP recommended that I get an ultrasound scan, and by the time I found out the results, I was certain that I was about to hear the worst news. So you can imagine my relief when the technician told me that it was merely a lipoma – a benign tumour, made of fat cells, that posed no serious threat to my health. Almost as soon as I found out, all those aches and pains vanished, and I soon started returning to my previous weight.
      
      The episode was my first – and so far, my only – experience of illness (or health) anxiety. According to the latest research, at least 6% of people will experience the condition during their lifetime.
      
      Although we don't yet have updated statistics, that number may have increased rapidly over the pandemic. With a continuous news cycle emphasising the symptoms and dangers of the virus, it is natural to feel a certain level of preoccupation about a possible infection. But for some people the fear of the virus will have been all-consuming, peaking as they await the results of a lateral flow or PCR test.
      
      The pandemic could have also exacerbated anxieties about other conditions. "I suspect that health anxiety has increased quite considerably during the pandemic, not least because people have had more time to ruminate and reflect on their symptoms," says Peter Tyrer, a professor in community psychiatry at Imperial College London.

      It may be no coincidence that my own episode occurred during a lockdown, when I was unable to visit friends who might have distracted me, and when I knew that I'd have restricted access to medical treatment, if it were needed.
      
      The last two years has shown there has never been a greater need for awareness about illness anxiety and its management.
      
      Hypochondriasis
      
      Our understanding of illness anxiety marks a vast departure from the historical view of the condition, which was once known as "hypochondriasis".
      
      The people suffering from this disorder were called hypochondriacs, and they were often belittled and ridiculed as time wasters. Many commentators argued that the "worried well" simply wanted to add a little drama to their lives. "It was regarded as a bit of joke," Tyrer says. "The assumption was that these people just loved talking about their complaints.
      It was only in 2013 that the American Psychiatric Association formally adopted the term "illness anxiety disorder" to describe people with disproportionate and debilitating concerns about their health. (In the medical literature "health anxiety" is often used as an alternative name.) Although hard data is lacking, the wider availability of information online may have increased the prevalence of illness anxiety in the past three decades, compared to the pre-Internet era.

Contrary to the idea that "hypochondriacs" are simply looking for attention, the origins of someone's illness anxiety are often highly specific. "There's often a trigger," says Helen Tyrer, a senior clinical research fellow at Imperial College London and author of the book Tackling Health Anxiety. (Helen and Peter Tyrer are a married couple who both research illness anxiety.) "It could be that somebody in the family has been ill. Or that they've heard about somebody their own age dying from a disease." In other cases, patients may develop excessive and continued worries about a previous illness such as cancer or heart attack returning, or a current condition – such as diabetes – worsening.

The condition is characterised by an obsessive checking of symptoms. Many of those afflicted spend hours each day researching potential illnesses online. "Every minute of the day, they’re checking whether they've got this disease or not," Helen Tyrer says. "It really is on a completely different scale to most people’s worries about their health." 

The continual worry results in many more visits to doctors’ surgeries and hospitals
"The repetitive thoughts are persistent and create a lot of distress," agrees Sophie Lebel, a clinical psychologist at the University of Ottawa, Canada, who specialises in the ways that people cope with cancer diagnoses.

As you may expect, the continual worry results in many more visits to doctors' surgeries and hospitals. One study of Danish patients found that people with severe illness anxiety used between 41% and 78% more health care, over a five-year period, than those with low illness anxiety.

Clearly, this comes at a financial cost, and the repeated medical visits may not bring much benefit to the patient, as they become convinced that the analysis was flawed. "The patient might think that it was too early to show up on a test, or that the results were muddled in the lab," says Helen Tyrer. 

Similarly, if you are suffering from high anxiety of Covid-19, a negative LFT or PCR result may not be enough to convince you that you are not infected. (Of course, this is justified to an extent – though positive LFT results are 99.97% accurate, the false negative rate is 28% on average for symptomatic individuals.)

The nocebo effect

In many situations, anxieties about our health can create the appearance of symptoms – a self-fulfilling prophecy that might seem to confirm our fears.

This phenomenon is evident in cases of "white coat syndrome" – in which the stress of visiting a doctor can raise people’s blood pressure, so that it appears they are experiencing hypertension. For this reason, some medical providers may provide you with a blood pressure monitor to take measurements at home when you are relaxed.

      "desc":`annah Miller says she’s always believed in soulmates. She remembers being a child, hearing that seahorses have one partner forever. She loved the idea there might be just one person for her, too.

      When she was 10, she was introduced to Sam, a friend of her sister’s, at a group outing to a theme park. She remembers him holding her hand on the scariest rides and her sister teasing her, saying she and Sam were going to get married. “It’s a bit embarrassing, but I did fall head over heels that day,” says Miller, 45, from Birmingham, UK. “I went on the school bus on Monday and told all my friends about the older boy who held my hand.”
      
      She didn’t cross paths with the boy from the theme park again until she was 18, but once she did, things moved quickly. Weeks later, Sam told Hannah that he was falling in love with her, and the two were married just before her 20th birthday. “Commitment felt like it came easily – this was it, we were meant to be together, so why wait,” she says. “We knew that there was no reason not to get married, because we were soulmates.”
      
      An astonishing number of people believe in soulmates, according to one 2021 survey; the idea of ‘The One’ carries across many other cultures, too. There are many reasons why people are hopeful that their perfect person is out there, and during the last 50 years, the idea has only increased in popularity. Experts believe that whether or not we believe in soulmates is deeply rooted in our personal circumstances and psychology – but it’s possible that those hoping to find a pre-destined partner might be dooming their relationships from the start.
      
      A brief history of soulmates
      
      The Greek philosopher Plato wrote that humans once had four arms, four legs and two faces. He explained that Zeus split us in half as a punishment for our pride, and we were destined to walk the Earth searching for our other half.
      
      Our understanding of love and relationships might have evolved since 385 BCE, when Plato penned Symposium, but the idea of having an ‘other half’ still endures for many, and has lasted across numerous cultures throughout history. Some Hindu traditions hold the idea that people have a karmic connection with certain souls; in Yiddish, there is a term for an ideal or predestined marriage partner – your ‘bashert’ – which loosely translates to destiny. Thirteenth-century Persian poet and Islamic scholar Rumi posed the idea that lovers do not finally meet, but that they are somehow in each other all along. And from Romeo and Juliet to Heathcliff and Cathy, Western literature is replete with examples of lovers who were meant to be together.
      But although the concept of a soulmate might have existed for thousands of years, the actual term was probably only introduced in the 19th Century. Its first recorded use is in 1822, in a letter written by poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. “To be happy in Married Life...  you must have a Soul-mate,” he wrote. Coleridge’s own love life was unhappy – he married mostly due to social pressures and spent most of the union apart from his wife, before they eventually separated for good.

Yet despite Coleridge’s inability to find a true soulmate, the idea persisted, rocketing in popularity, especially in recent decades. Brad Wilcox, a professor of sociology and director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, US, notes  a rise in the appeal of soulmates since the 1970s, when the advent of what he calls the “me decade” and a culture of individualism shifted our approach to relationships.

“People are now more likely to look for relationships that make them happy and fulfilled,” he says. “It’s also facilitated by unprecedented prosperity in the West, which made people less dependent on marriage for economic survival. There was a shift from a pragmatic approach to marriage to a more expressive, soulmate model of marriage where people’s expectations are more psychological and less material.”

The enduring nature of the soulmate myth

There are plenty of reasons to be sceptical about the idea of a perfect person being predestined for you. After all, most people don’t stray far when finding their partner, with the majority of Americans marrying someone from the same state as them, and 43% marrying someone who they went to high school or college with.

On a planet of nearly eight billion people, it’s quite a coincidence that so many peoples’ soulmates are just in the next classroom. Yet the idea of a soulmate has persisted across numerous societies and time periods – what is it about the concept of The One that people find so irresistible?

Bradley Onishi, an associate professor of religion at Skidmore College, US, has used his background in the history of ideas to try and understand the enduring nature of soulmate mythology. He believes that there is something innate in our desire to believe in soulmates.

The soulmate myth promises that amidst the dizzying and often confusing landscape of dating apps there is one match out there that will make sense of it all – Bradley Onishi
“The soulmate myth promises fulfilment,” says Onishi. “It says that the isolation and loneliness that are so often part of the human experience are only temporary – that someday there will be a happily ever after in which we are united with The One who understands us at every level, protects us from harm and gives our life overwhelming significance.”

He points out that, for many of us, believing in a soulmate is a way of constructing a cohesive narrative from the oftentimes chaotic and unpredictable experience of looking for love. “The soulmate myth is really good at taking all the bad first dates, the breakups, the dashed hopes and disappointments and putting them into a story that says ‘someday all of this will fall into place’,” he says.

This is particularly true when it comes to modern dating, perhaps explaining how the soulmate idea has evolved over time. In recent years, the term ‘twin flame’ has surged in popularity, a more spiritual way of understanding the idea that there might be someone that you are simply supposed to be with.

“We live in a time of overwhelming uncertainty – politically, environmentally and socially,” explains Onishi. “The soulmate myth promises that amidst the dizzying and often confusing landscape of dating apps there is one match out there that will make sense of it all. It promises an anchor to modern life that many find appealing.”

Practical expectations?

Practically, looking for a soulmate may not be the best approach, however. “Soulmate marriages are more fragile because feelings fluctuate,” Wilcox says. “Having a less soulmate-based approach is linked to more stability.”

Research into hundreds of relationships has showed having an expectation of finding a soulmate actually leads to dysfunctional patterns of behaviour and even makes you more likely to breakup with your partner. This is because people who believe in soulmates tend to have what is known as a ‘destiny’ mindset. Since they are holding out for a perfect person, they are more likely to doubt their relationship, or view a hiccup in the road as a dealbreaker – perhaps this just wasn’t their person after all.`,

      "desc":`There was a rumour going around that a group of climbers was accessing the park illegally before opening day. Pete Davis, operations manager at the Ouray Ice Park in Colorado, set off to investigate. I followed him along the snow-packed edge of the Uncompahgre Gorge. Beneath us were cascading sheets of ice, frozen to the cliffside. The park wasn't due to open for another three days, but everyone – climbers and staff alike – was anxious to get the season started.

      The Ouray Ice Park sits at the mouth of a narrow box canyon sculpted by the Uncompahgre River. Here on the western edge of the Rocky Mountains in the south-west United States, the landscape pivots quickly from jagged alpine terrain to red rock plateau. Just below the park is Ouray, a historical mining town that's now a bustling hub for outdoor recreation. It's known as the "Switzerland of America".
      As we picked our way up the canyon, Davis used an ice axe to point out the various projects his staff were rushing to complete before opening day. There was signage to erect, a new bridge to inspect, and of course, lots of ice to grow. The waterfalls in the Ouray Ice Park are entirely manmade, created by a small team of "ice farmers".

He showed me the lines of water pipes and sprinklers situated along the cliff edge. There are more than 200 of these sprinklers, which spray water directly onto the rock, creating walls of ice containing 100-plus climbs. Starting in November when the temperature drops, the ice farmers saturate the rock with water to cool it, essentially building a canvas for the waterfalls. They use existing features on the rock, like overhangs, to grow a variety of routes for all skill levels.

Though the job involves extensive manual labour in freezing weather, Davis described growing ice as a kind of art form. "Because it's not really a natural phenomenon to have showerheads, you know, flowing on mountain ice climbs."
In the wild, climbable ice forms as either a frozen waterfall or as water seepingout of the rock. The park attempts to mimic both styles. Steve Imhoff, a second-year ice farmer, said their ultimate goal is to create routes that are challenging to both the mind and body by fine-tuning the valves and observing the water spray.

"You get up real early in the morning, and the first job is to turn the water off before everyone gets there," Imhoff said. "You get this moment when you're one-on-one with the ice park, just out there in your element."

If half an ice farmer's job is creation, the other half is maintenance and repair. Exposed water pipes in the mountains are prone to freeze and break. Last year, there was a 150ft section of piping suspended in trees that froze twice. They had to scramble into the branches to remove and repair sections, a process that took nearly four days.

You get this moment when you're one-on-one with the ice park, just out there in your element – Steve Imhoff
Like most seasonal jobs, ice farming ends when the park closes, usually in March. Some of the farmers leave Ouray to pursue work in other states. Sarah Goodnow, a first-year ice farmer, works as a wildland firefighter, literally dividing her year into fire and ice. She said she's attracted to manual labour in the outdoors, something both jobs offer plenty of.

"It just sort of happened," Goodnow said. "Fire and the ice park happened to be the opportunities that presented themselves."

Other farmers work as rope access technicians, providing support on wind turbines. Before taking a full-time position at the park, Davis spent his summers working as an archaeologis

      Curry, who was two points short of the scoring record set by Anthony Davis in 2017, won the Kobe Bryant Trophy as the All-Star Game's most valuable player.
      
      The All-Star MVP Award was permanently renamed in honour of LA Lakers legend Bryant, an 18-time All-Star, after he and his daughter Gianna were among nine people killed in a helicopter crash in 2020.
      
      LeBron James also played in his 18th All-Star Game to sit one short of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record.
      
      The The Los Angeles Lakers star made the game-winning shot on Sunday after his team had been set a target winning score of 163 in Cleveland.
      That target was determined after Team Durant held a 139-138 lead heading into the final quarter and, for a third consecutive year, 24 points were added to the leading total to reflect Kobe Bryant's jersey number.

Curry surpassed Ray Allen at the top of the the all-time list for threes made and was honoured as a member of the NBA 75th Anniversary Team at half-time.

James made 24 points for his side and Giannis Antetokounmpo, of the Milwaukee Bucks, added 30 points and 12 rebounds.

Team Durant were led by the Philadelphia 76ers' Joel Embiid, who recorded 36 points and 10 rebounds, while Devin Booker of the Phoenix Suns contributed 20 points.`,

      "desc":`Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau have distanced themselves from a Saudi-backed Super League by reaffirming their commitment to the PGA Tour.

      The two American major winners were the biggest names associated with the proposed breakaway league.
      
      Their decision to back the established US circuit is a major blow to the upstart project fronted by former world number one Greg Norman.
      
      Four-time Major winner Rory McIlroy said the idea was "dead in the water".
      
      "Who's left? Who's left to go? I mean, there's no one. It's dead in the water in my opinion. I just can't see any reason why anyone would go," McIlroy, 32, said.
      
      "No one really knew where Bryson stood. I was really glad to see DJ and Bryson put out those statements this week. We all want to play against the best players in the world and they're certainly two of the best players in the world."
      
      Those who join the new league could be banned from the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and Ryder Cup.
      
      Former world number one Johnson, 37, is a two-time winner of the Saudi International tournament and had been closely linked with the proposed league.
      
      But the 2020 Masters champion has quashed rumours he was about to defect, saying he was "fully committed to the PGA Tour."
      
      "Over the past several months, there has been a great deal of speculation about an alternative tour; much of which seems to have included me and my future in professional golf," Johnson said in a statement issued through the PGA Tour.
      
      "I feel it is now time to put such speculation to rest. I am grateful for the opportunity to play on the best tour in the world and for all it has provided me and my family.
      
      "While there will always be areas where our tour can improve and evolve, I am thankful for our leadership and the many sponsors who make the PGA Tour golf's premier tour."
      
      DeChambeau, 28, had been rumoured to have been offered more than $100m (£73.6m) to be the figurehead for the Saudi-backed league.
      
      But soon after Johnson's statement the former US Open winner also distanced himself from the project on social media.
      
      "While there has been a lot of speculation surrounding my support for another tour, I want to make it very clear that as long as the best players in the world are playing the PGA Tour, so will I," DeChambeau tweeted.
      
      "As of now, I am focused on getting myself healthy and competing again soon. I appreciate all the support."
      
      DeChambeau, Johnson and Phil Mickelson were expected to be the top names who would lead the breakaway.
      
      European Ryder Cup stars Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and Graeme McDowell are also thought to be considering offers to join.
      
      However, Johnson and DeChambeau's rejection of the project is a significant setback.
      
      Major-winning stars including McIlroy, world number one Jon Rahm, Open champion Collin Morikawa and Justin Thomas have already said they are not interested.
      
      Last week it was claimed 20 leading players had already signed up, but now a breakaway league seems a much more distant prospect.
      
      Mickelson comments disappoint McIlroy
      McIlroy also criticised comments made by six-time major winner Mickelson about the prospect of joining the breakaway league.
      
      Mickelson called it "a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates".
      
      He added: "The Tour likes to pretend it's a democracy, but it's really a dictatorship."
      
      Asked about these comments, McIlroy said: "I don't want to kick someone while he's down obviously, but I thought they were naive, selfish, egotistical, ignorant.
      
      "It was just very surprising and disappointing, sad. I'm sure he's sitting at home sort of rethinking his position and where he goes from here."`,
